I can think of all the times</br>
You told me not to touch the light</br>
I never thought that you would be the one</br>
</p>

<p align="center"> <font color="042931" size="5" face="Dante">
I couldn't really justify</br>
How you even thought it could be right</br>
Cause everything we cherished is gone</br>
And in the end can you tell me if</br>
It was worth the try</br>
So I can decide</br>
</p>

<p align="center"> <font color="042931" size="5" face="Dante">
Leaves will soon grow from the bareness of trees</br>
And all will be alright in time</br>
From waves overgrown come the calmest of seas</br>
And all will be alright in time</br>
Ohh you never really love someone until you learn to forgive</br>
</p>

<p align="center"> <font color="042931" size="5" face="Dante">
Try as hard as I might</br>
To flee the shadows of the night</br>
It haunts me and it makes me feel blue</br>
But how can I try to hide</br>
When every breath and every hour</br>
I still end up thinking of you</br>
And in the end everything we have</br>
Makes it worth the fight</br>
So I will hold on for as long</br>
</p>

<p align="center"> <font color="042931" size="5" face="Dante">
As leaves will soon grow from the bareness of trees</br>
And all will be alright in time</br>
From waves overgrown come the calmest of seas</br>
And all will be alright in time</br>
Ohh you never really love someone until you learn to forgive</br>
</p>

<p align="center"> <font color="042931" size="5" face="Dante">
I never thought that I would see the day</br>
That I'd decide if I should leave or stay</br>
But in the end what makes it worth the fight's</br>
That no matter what happens we try to make it right</br>
</p>

<p align="center"> <font color="042931" size="5" face="Dante"> 
Leaves will soon grow from the bareness of trees</br>
And all will be alright in time</br>
From waves overgrown come the calmest of seas</br>
And all will be alright in time</br>
Wounds of the past will eventually heal</br>
And all will be alright in time</br> 
'Cause all of this comes with a love that is real</br>
I said all will be alright in time</br>
I said all will be alright in time</br>
I said all will be alright in time</br>
All will be alright in time</br>
Ohh, you never really love someone until</br>
You learn to forgive</br>
You learn to forgive</br>
Learn to forgive</br>
